This is a an extension for Drive Badger. It provides `exclude.list` file, containing a list of exclusions compatible with popular `rsync` program.

The purpose of these exclusions is to decrease the amount of data to be exfiltrated by Drive Badger, and thus to speed up the attack,
by eliminating files and directories, that are not valuable in any way to the attacker:

- virus databases for many anti-virus products
- other downloaded updates for such software
- quarantined files (almost always in encrypted form, useless for anyone other than particular software vendor)

### Installing
